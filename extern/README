This directory contains binaries of some externally developed tools, that 
are available under various open source licenses.
The binaries have been cross-compiled to an older glibc (2.2.2) to avoid
compatibility problems with some older installations.
Some of the original README/LICENSE files have been included under 
a program_docs directory.

gnusort8 comes from GNU coreutils 8.9, but has been patched to support
natural sorting. The patched sort.c has been included in the gnusort8_docs.

tabix and bgzip by Heng Li have had some small modifications for making static executables.

The razip binary is compiled from sources distributed with samtools 0.1.5c, 
but some patches have been applied to fix some issues (e.g. with large files).
Source files that have been changed are included in razip_docs
