NAME
----
lz4ra - a random access decompressor for the lz4 format. 

SYNOPSIS
--------
lz4ra filename.lz4 ?start? ?size? ...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
lz4ra can decompress an lz4 file starting from a given (uncompressed)
position, and continue up to a given (uncompressed) size. The uncompressed
data is sent to stdout. lz4ra with only the filename as parameter will decompress the
entire file to stdout. Multiple start size ranges can be given: the ranges
will be concatenated in the output

For faster access, an index file (with the name filename.lz4i) can be made using:
lz4index filename.lz4

DETAILS
-------
lz4ra works by skipping compressed blocks up to the one containing the
start site; this block is decompressed entirely, and output starts from
the given start size. This works only for lz4 files with independent
blocks (default).

The lz4i file contains a list of the starting positions of the blocks in a
binary format (prepended with a yaml header describing the binary data.
With this index the position of the start block can be obtained directly
without parsing and skipping blocks in the lz4 file.
