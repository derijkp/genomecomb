<h1>GenomeComb</h1>

<h1 class=subtitle>Home</h1>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>Genomecomb is an integrated, flexible package for the analysis of
genome and transcriptome sequencing, supporting the entire workflow for
both short and long read sequencing data: It provides both a pipeline to
produce files such as annotated variant and structural variant files, and
transcript predictions and counts starting from raw data, as well as tools
to further to analyse these by for example flexible filtering according to
your project.</p>

<h2>Main features</h2>

<p>In addition to providing <a href="install.html" >installation directives</a>, 
extensive <a href="intro.html">documentation</a>, we also provide a shortlist of 
common "<a href="howto.html">protocols</a>" used to analyse whole genome sequencing data. 
A short list of analyses that can be performed using GenomeComb is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flexible, multi-technology, multi-omics analysis pipeline
<ul>
  <li>Starting from raw data, can run combinations of multiple, selectable analysis 
      tools in parallel and integrate the results into easily searchable files. 
  <li>Supports genome as well as trancriptome sequencing using Illumina as well as Nanopore data
  <li>Can run on a single machine (using multiple cores) or on heavily distributed on a cluster.
  <li>Extensive annotation, using publicly available data (e.g. UCSC tracks) or custom annotation tracks
</ul>
<li>Powerful queries
<ul>
  <li>All files (variant, genome region, transcript, ..) files can be filtered using advanced queries,
      supporting combinations of multiple analysis methods
  <li>Both a command line and a graphical interface
  <li>Supports browsing and querying the large data (several gigabytes) generated in NGS.
  <li>Adding calculated fields to a file
  <li>Summaries
  <li>Results and summaries can also be further queried
</ul>
<li>Other tools
<ul>
  <li>Genetic analyses (homwes, compound heterozygotes, ...)
  <li>Quantification of the sequenced and filtered regions in a genome
  <li>Set operations on genome regions and variant files: compare, join, subtract
  <li>Automated primer design for Sanger or Sequenom validation directly from the variant files
</ul>
</ul>

<p>We have used a very early version of GenomeComb in the analysis of whole genome sequences of monozygotic twin genomes, 
tumor-normal genomes and publicly available HapMap genomes.
