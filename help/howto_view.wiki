= Howto view results =

This text gives examples of how to view results in a [[projectdir]] using the gui [[cg_viz]].

In the howto, the smal example and test data set ori_mixed_yri_mx2 downloadable from the genomecomb
website will be used. This data set was derived from publically available exome and genome
sequencing data by extracting only raw data covering the region of the MX2 gene (on
chr21) and a part of the ACO2 gene (on chr22).

This howto expects a processed projectdir in tmp/mixed_yri_mx2. This can
be created following the directions in [[howto_process_project]]. 
Alternatively you could also copy it from the expected dir (or adapt the path):
{{{
	cp -a expected/mixed_yri_mx2 tmp/mixed_yri_mx2
}}}

== Startup ==
Start up [[cg_viz]] using
{{{
cg viz tmp/mixed_yri_mx2/compar/annot_compar-mixed_yri_mx2.tsv.zst
}}}
This opens the annotated combined variant file (fomrmat described in [[tsv]])
using cg viz, allowing you to browse through the table (even if it is
millions of lines long).

== Fields ==
You can use the **Fields** button to limit the number of fields you want
to see. The list on the right of the dialog shows the currently
displayed fields. The list on the left shows available fields.
Sample specific fields are indicated by having a - followed by a sample suffix.
We will select to display only a limited set of sample specific fields:

* Click "Fields"
* Filter all sample specific fields in the right list by typing a - in the Filter field above it
* Use the left button (<-) to remove all these fields from display (right list)
* Delete the - in the filter to show the remaining fields again
* Click on the "alt" field; we will add back some of the sample fields after this field
* In the "Filter" field in the left selection box, enter "^zyg|^qual"; 
only fields starting with "zyg" or "qual" will be shown
* Use the right arrow button (->) to add them to the display
* You may also add or remove fields by selecting them with the mouse, and using the "<-" or "->" button
* Click "Go"
Now only the selected fields are displayed. Longer field names in the
title line are cut off; make these visible by selecting the line between
title and table, and drag it lower.

The sample fields have a specific format, e.g.
; zyg-gatk-rdsbwa-exNA19240mx2: indicates the zygosity (as described in
[[tsv]]) for this variant by the gatk variant caller on the reads aligned
using bwa of the sample exNA19240mx2.
; zyg-sam-rdsbwa-exNA19240mx2: contains the zygosity according to the sam variant caller for
the same sequence sample.
; zyg-gatk-rdsbwa-gilNA19240mx2: The same biological sample (NA19240) was
also genome sequenced, and sequence sample gilNA19240mx2 contains this
data. zyg-gatk-rdsbwa-gilNA19240mx2 is then the zygosity called using the
same analysis tools on the genome sequence sample.

When combining sample results, process_project will check if a variant is not present
in a sample variant list, whether this is due to actually being reference (zyg = r) or being
unsequenced (zyg = u), according to the criteria used.
also other data, such as the quality of the "variant" call, is added for the reference calls
where possible. You can see that no quality value is available (quality-* = ?) 
for unsequenced variants (zyg-* = u)

== Query ==
You can use **Query** to show only lines that fit a number of criteria.
The query language is the same as supported by [[cg_select]] and the specifics
can be found in the [[cg_select]] help.
You can type a query directly into the Query field at the top, e.g. type 
{{{$zyg-gatk-rdsbwa-gilNA19240mx2 == "m"}}}
to select only variants that are homozygous gatk calls for sample gilNA19240mx2
and press Enter. 

You can use the "Query" button to get help in building queries
or the "EasyQuery" button for adding some common queries in an easier way.

== Summaries ==
The **Summaries** button can be used to create summary data. This provides
functionality similar to the -g and -gc options in [[cg_select]] (more
info in the [[cg_select]] help), but you can select fields etc. in the GUI.

For example:
* Click Summaries
* Select "chromosome" in the fields column (left)
* Click "Add to row grouping" (top right)
* Click "Summary" button at the bottom
* The number of variants per chromosome is shown
* Clear the query and press Enter to change to a summary of the full data set
* Select "data" in the Selection button next to the Summaries button to return to the normal data view

== Tree view ==
Make the **tree view** on the left larger by dragging the dividing line to the right.
Here you can select other result files to view. 
* Click on reports directory in compar. This contains combined reports data. 
Individual (more extensive) reports are in the sampledirs.
* Select report_stats-mixed_yri_mx2.tsv
* Enter {{{$parameter eq "fw_numreads"}}} as a query
* See the number of reads in the fastq files for each sample (that started from fastq files)
