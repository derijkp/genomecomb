Analysis was performed in-house with a standardized pipeline integrated in
genomecomb (1) The pipeline used fastq-mcf (2) for adapter clipping. Reads
were aligned to the hg38 genome reference (3) using bwa mem (4) and the
resulting sam file converted to bam using samtools (5). Bam files were
sorted and duplicates were removed using samtools markdup (5). Realignment
in the neighborhood of indels was performed with GATK (6). Variants were
called at all positions with a totalcoverage >= 5 using both GATK
haplotype caller (7) and strelka (8). At the initial stage positions with
a coverage < 8 or a genotype quality score < 25 were considered
unsequenced. Structural variants were called using manta (9) and lumpy
(10). The resulting variant sets of different individuals were combined
and annotated using genomecomb (1).

Amplicon sequencing
-------------------
Analysis was performed in-house with a standardized pipeline integrated in
genomecomb (1) The pipeline used fastq-mcf (2) for adapter clipping. Reads
were then aligned using bwa mem (3) and the resulting sam file converted
to bam using samtools (4). bam files were sorted using samtools sort (4).
Realignment in the neighborhood of indels was performed with GATK (5).
Amplicon primers were clipped using genomecomb (1). Variants were called
at all positions with a totalcoverage >= 5 using both GATK (5) and
samtools (4). At this initial stage positions with a coverage < 5 or a
score < 30 were considered unsequenced. The resulting variant sets of
different individuals were combined and annotated and filtered using
genomecomb (1).
