= Genomecomb file formats =

Most files are in the [[tsv]] format (tab-separated value), a simple but flexible format.
The general tsv format is described in [[format_tsv]]. Some tsv formats for specific data require
(or often have) specific fields:
; region file format: for storing genomic region information, explained in [[format_tsv]]
; variant file format: for storing variants, explained in [[format_tsv]]
; GATK variant data: [[format_gatk_vars]] explains the fields typically found in GATK called variants
; samtools variant data: [[format_sam_vars]] explains the fields typically found in samtools called variants

; bcol format: 
[[format_bcol]] descibes the bcol format. This is a (partly) binary format that is more efficient
at storing value data for all bases in the genome.

; project directory: 
[[format_project]] explains the structure of a genomecomb project directory.
While not strictly a file format, it is a specific directory structure created by
(and expected by) some genomecomb tools.
