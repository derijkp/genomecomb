= tsv format =

The standard file format used in GenomeComb is the widely supported,
simple, yet flexible [[http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/text/tab-separated-values|tab-separated values file]] (tsv).
A tsv file is a simple text file containing tabular data, where each line
represents a record or row in the table.
Each field value of a record is separated from the next by a tab character.
As values cannot be quoted (as in csv), they cannot contain tabs or newlines,
unless by coding them e.g. by using escape characters (\t,\n)

The first line of the tab file (not starting with a #) is a **header**
that contains column names (or fields). Genomecomb allows comment lines (indicated by
starting the line with a # character) containing metadata to precede the header.

Depending on the columns present, tsv files can be used for various purposes. Usually 
the files are used to describe features on a reference genome sequence. In this
context, Genomecomb recognizes columns with specific field names to have a special meaning.
The order/position of the columns does not matter, although genomecomb will usually write
tsv files with columns in a specific order.
All tsv files can be easily **queried** using the [[cg_select]] functionality
or loaded into a local database.

== region file format ==
Region files are used to indicate regions on the genome, and potentially
associate some name, score, annotation, ... to it. Region files contain at
least the following fields:
; chromosome: a string indicating the chromosome name.
; begin: a number indicating the start of the region (half-open coordinates). 
; end: a number indicating the end of the region (half-open coordinates)
Any extra columns can be added to provide information on the region.

Coordinates are in zero-based half-open format as used by UCSC bed
files and Complete Genomics files. This means for instance
that the first base of a sequence will be indicated by begin=0 and end=1.
It is possible to indicate regions not containing a base, e.g. the position/region
before the first base would be indicated by begin=0, end=0.
**chromosome** is a just a string. Many genomecomb tools allow mixing "chr1" 
and "1" type of notation for chromosome, meaning that "chr1 1 2" is considered the 
same region as "1 1 2".

Most genomecomb tools expect region files to be **sorted** on chromosome, begin, end 
(and files created by genomecomb are usually sorted).
You can sort files using the -s option of [[cg_select]]. 
Use -s - to sort using the default expected sort order:
{{{cg select -s - file sortedfile}}}
For chromosome names, a natural sort is (to be) used. 
This sorts strings alphabetically except that multi-digit numbers are
ordered as a single character, meaning that chr11 will come (as expected
by most humans) after chr2 instead of before (as the typically used
lexical sort would do)

If the normal chromosome, begin, end fields are not present, the following 
alternative fieldnames are also recognized:
; chromosome: "chrom", "chr", "chr1", "genoName", "tName" and "contig"
; begin: "start", "end1", "chromStart", "genoStart", "tStart", txStart", "pos" and "offset"
(end1 is recognised as begin because of the structural variant code in genomecomb, where start1,end1
and start2,end2 regions surround a SV).
; end: "start2", "chromEnd", "genoEnd", "tEnd" or "txEnd"

== variant file format ==
A variant file is a tsv file containing a list of variants. chromosome, begin and end fields 
indicate the location of the variant in the same way as in region files, while other fields
define the variant at the location: The following basic fields are present in a variant file:
; chromosome: chromosome name.
; begin: start of the region (half-open coordinates). 
; end: end of the region (half-open coordinates)
; type: type of variation: snp, ins, del, sub are recognised
; ref: genotype of the reference sequence at the feature. For large deletions, the size 
of the deletion can be used. Insertions will have an empty string as ref. (also reference)
; alt: alternative allele(s). If there are more than one alternatives, they are 
separated by commas. Deletions have an empty string as alt allele. (also alternative)

Variant files should be **sorted** on the fields chromosome, begin, end, type, alt (in that order).

Further fields can be present to describe the variant in the sample or annotation information,
many depending on the variant caller used (e.g. [[gatk_vars]] and [[sam_vars]]).
The following fields have specific meanings in genomecomb:
; sequenced:  single letter code describing sequencing status (described below) 
; zyg: zygosity, a single letter code indicating the zygosity of sample for the variant. (described below)
; alleleSeq1: genotype of variant at one allele
; alleleSeq2: genotype of variant at other allele
; phased: order of genotypes in alleleSeq1 and alleleSeq2 is significant (phase is known)
; quality: quality of the variant (or reference) call, assigned by the variant caller. Normally phred scaled: -10log_10 prob(call in ALT is wrong))
; coverage: number of reads used to call the variant (covering the variant). 
This is as reported by the variant caller; Interpretation of coverage can differ
between different callers

genomecomb has 2 options to deal with the presence of multiple alternative
alleles on the same position:
; split: Each alternative allele is on a seperate line. e.g. A to G,C
variant (multialleic notation) is split into an A to G and an A to C variant.
While [[cg_select]] can select based on lists in fields (as in multiallelic mode), 
split mode makes querying and selection of variants much easier.
Split mode is the default.
; multiallelic: one line per position and type. All alternative alleles
are in one line in the variant file. The alt field contains a list
(separated by commas) of alternative alleles. If any of the other fields
contains values specific to an allele (e.g. frequency of the allele in a population),
this field will contain a comma separated list with values in the order as the
alt alleles list

=== sequenced field ===
The sequenced field indicates sequenig status of the variant in the sample. The following codes
can be found:
;u: the position is considered unsequenced in the sample (e.g. because coverage or quality was too low).
;v: the variant was found in the sample.
;r: the position was sequenced, but the given variant is not present 
In multiallelic mode, r allways means that the genotype is reference. In
split mode however, "v" will only be assigned if the specific alternative
is present in the genotype. So "r" will be used even if there are
non-reference alleles, as long as they are not the given alternative!

When calling variants using GATK or samtools, genomecomb picks a
relatively low quality treshhold (coverage < 5 or quality < 30) for
considering variants unsequenced (sensitiviy over specificity). You can
allways apply more stringent quality filtering on the result using [[cg_select]].

=== zyg ===
Possible zyg codes are:
; m: homozygous; the sample has two times the given alternative allele
; t: heterozygous; the sample has the given alternative allele and one reference allele
; c: compound; the sample has two different non-reference alleles. In split mode, c is only 
used if one the those is the given variant alt allele.
; o: other; This is only used in split mode when the sample contains non-reference alleles 
other than the variant alt allele.
; r: reference
; u: unspecified/unsequenced
It is possible to have an assigned zyg other than u (e.g. t) even when the sequenced field is u,
meaning that the variant caller could make a zygosity estimate/prediction, but the variant 
call is not of enough quality to consider it sequenced.

== Structural variants ==
Structural variants use basically the same format as small variants, but
are usually in separate files because they are compared and queried
differently. The only difference is in the extra types (inv, trans, bnd)
and different alt notations for these types.
For an inversion (inv) the alternative genotype (alt) is indicated by an "i".
Translocations (trans) and breakends (bnd) are indicated by a position on
the breakpoint ( zero length location like for an insertion). The 
alt is indicated by the following patterns, where **chr:pos** gives the location
the variant location is linked to. (AS for insertions, pos here points to
a location between bases) **s** can be pesent to indicate inserted bases
in the breakpoint:
* .s[chr:pos[	The sequence starting after **chr:pos** is added after the variant location
* .s]chr:pos]	The (reverse complement of) sequence before **chr:pos** is joined after the variant location
* ]chr:pos]s.	The sequence starting after **chr:pos** is added before the variant location
* [chr:pos[s.	The (reverse complement of) sequence after **chr:pos** is joined before the variant location

== multicompar file ==
In a multicompar file, data for different samples is present in one file,
so they can be compared. Fields that are specific to a sample have the
samplename added to the fieldname separated by a dash, e.g. the zygosity
of a variant in sample1 can be found in the column named zyg-sample1.
The same sample can be analysed using different methods (aligners, 
variant callers). This is indicated using fieldname-methods-sample. (The
methods-sample part is called the anlysis.)

A small example multicompar variant file with two samples would contain the following fields
; chromosome: chromosome name.
; begin: start of the region (half-open coordinates). 
; end: end of the region (half-open coordinates)
; type: type of variation: snp, ins, del, sub are recognised
; ref: reference sequence
; alt: alternative allele(s).
; sequenced-gatkh-rdsbwa-sample1:  sequencing status of sample1, based on the gatk haplotypecaller (gatkh) on a cleaned bwa alignment
; zyg-gatkh-rdsbwa-sample1: zygosity of sample1
; quality-gatkh-rdsbwa-sample1: variant quality in sample1
; alleleSeq1-gatkh-rdsbwa-sample1: genotype of variant at one allele in sample1
; alleleSeq2-gatkh-rdsbwa-sample1: genotype of variant at other allele in sample1
; sequenced-gatkh-rdsbwa-sample2:  sequencing status of sample2
; zyg-gatkh-rdsbwa-sample2: zygosity of sample2
; quality-gatkh-rdsbwa-sample2: variant quality in sample2
; alleleSeq1-gatkh-rdsbwa-sample2: genotype of variant at one allele in sample2
; alleleSeq2-gatkh-rdsbwa-sample2: genotype of variant at other allele in sample2

== tab based bioinformatics formats ==
Some formats used in bioinformatics contain data in a tab separated format where the header 
does not conform to the tsv specs. Most Genomecomb commands will detect and support some 
of these alternative comments/header styles:
; sam: starts with "@HD	VN", header lines start with @, uses fixed columns
; vcf: starts with "##fileformat=VCF", the last "comment" line contains the header.
In order to extract the data merged in some of the vcf fields into a genomecomb supported tsv,
use [[cg_vcf2tsv|cg vcf2tsv]]
; Complete genomics: header line is preceeded by an empty line and starts with a > character
