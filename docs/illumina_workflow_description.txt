Analysis was performed in-house with a standardized pipeline integrated in
genomecomb (1) The pipeline used fastq-mcf (2) for adapter clipping. Reads
were then aligned using bwa mem (3) and the resulting sam file converted
to bam using samtools (4). Bam files were sorted and duplicates were
removed using biobambam bammarkduplicates2 (5). Realignment in the
neighborhood of indels was performed with GATK (6). Variants were called
at all positions with a totalcoverage >= 5 using both GATK (6) and
samtools (4). At this initial stage positions with a coverage < 5 or a
quality score < 30 were considered unsequenced. The resulting variant sets of
different individuals were combined and annotated using genomecomb (1).

Analysis was performed in-house with a standardized pipeline integrated in
genomecomb (1) The pipeline used fastq-mcf (2) for adapter clipping. Reads
were then aligned using bwa mem (3) and the resulting sam file converted

Realignment in the neighborhood of indels was performed with GATK (6).
Amplicon primers were clipped using genomecomb (1). Variants were called
at all positions with a totalcoverage >= 5 using both GATK (6) and
