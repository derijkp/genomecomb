Analysis was performed in-house with a standardized pipeline integrated in
genomecomb (1) The pipeline used fastq-mcf (2) for adapter clipping. Reads
were then aligned using bwa mem (3) to the hg19 genome reference (4) and the resulting sam file converted
to bam using samtools (5). Bam files were sorted and duplicates were
removed using samtools markdup (5). Realignment in the
neighborhood of indels was performed with GATK (6). Variants were called
at all positions with a totalcoverage >= 5 using both GATK (6) and
samtools (5). At this initial stage positions with a coverage < 5 or a
quality score < 30 were considered unsequenced. The resulting variant sets of
different individuals were combined and annotated using genomecomb (1).
