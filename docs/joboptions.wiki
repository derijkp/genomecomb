cg command ?joboptions? ...

== Summary ==
Several commands understand these job options

== Description ==
Several genomecomb commands (indicated by "supports job options" in their help) consist
of sub tasks (jobs) that can be run in parallel. If you have multiple
cores/threads available, you can use the option -d (or -distribute or
--distribute) with a number to distribute the jobs over the given number
of processes (on the same computer). "sge" instead of a number can be used
to distribute jobs on a cluster managed by Grid Engine.

Without the -d option, jobs are run one after the other (using only 1
core). However, if such a command is interupted, it can continue from the
already processed data by giving the same command.

Job enabled commands all support the following options:

== Options ==
; **-d value** (--distribute): if value is a number, the job is distributed over the given number of processes. Use sge to distribute using Grid Engine  (also -distribute)
; **-f 0/1** (--force): use -f 1 to rerun all jobs, even if some were actually already successfully finished (also -force)
; **--silent 0/1**: use -silent 1 to supress output with info on the processing
; **--job_skiperrors 0/1**: When running directly (without -d), errors will
cause the command to stop; use -skiperrors 1 to (also) skip over errors in this mode of running
