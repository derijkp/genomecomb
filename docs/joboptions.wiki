cg command ?joboptions? ...

== Summary ==
Several commands understand these job options

== Description ==
Several genomecomb commands (indicated by "supports job options" in their help) consist
of sub tasks (jobs) that can be run in parallel. If you have multiple
cores/threads available, you can use the option -d (or -distribute or
--distribute) with a number to distribute the jobs over the given number
of processes (on the same computer). "sge" instead of a number can be used
to distribute jobs on a cluster managed by Grid Engine.

Without the -d option, jobs are run one after the other (using only 1
core). However, if such a command is interupted, it can continue from the
already processed data by giving the same command.

All job enabled commands support the following options:

== Options ==
; -d value (--distribute): if value is a number, the job is distributed over the given number of processes. Use sge to distribute using Grid Engine  (also -distribute)
; -v number (--verbose): This general option has a big effect on job enabled commands:
If it is > 0, they will output a lot of info (to stder) on dependencies, jobs started, etc.
; -f 0/1 (--force): use -f 1 to rerun all jobs, even if some were actually already successfully finished (also -force)
; --skipjoberrors 0/1: Errors in one job cause the entire command to stop; 
use --skipjoberrors 1 to skip over these errors and complete other jobs (as far as they are not
dependent on the the job with an error) (also -skipjoberrors)
