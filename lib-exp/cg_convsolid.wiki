== Summary ==
Split and convert xsq files (from solid 5500xl) into csfasta, and distribute over projects

== Description ==
based on a projectfile, multiple xsq solid runs can be split, converted and distributed over experiments.
The project file is a tab separated file, where each line represents a barcoded part of the run.
It must contain following fields: experiment, sample, source, barcode.
**experiment** is a directory downloaded from the machine, containing the original xsq files.
The run data tagged with **barcode** will be stored in **experiment**/**sample**/**csfasta** in csfasta format
All files are searched and saved within the working directory, that is the directory where the 
projectfile is found. 

The command expects the xsq tools (convertFromXSQ.sh) to be available in the PATH
