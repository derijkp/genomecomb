GenomeComb
========== A program for the analysis of complete genome data
           Copyright 2010 VIB and Universiteit Antwerpen

Purpose
-------
Genomecomb is a package designed for the analysis of complete genome data.
It can be used to compare, annotate and especially filter the results of
complete genome sequencing.

System requirements and Installation
------------------------------------
Updates and more information can be found on the website
http://genomecomb.sourceforge.net/

Binary packages are available for Linux. The application 
uses the concept of an application directory: Everything needed to run
the application is in one directory: installation is as simple as moving
the directory to the place you want it (unpacking it, if it is compressed).
Uninstallation is done by removing the directory.
The executable (cg) must stay in the application directory to work.
If you want to be able to start it from another location (desktop, bin),
make a link to it.

A general overview of how to use the program is given in the help.
You can get help from the program itself using the command
cg help

Bugs
----
If you are having problems with the program contact me. I will
do my best to get it fixed. Please report any bugs you have
found. If possible, state your machine's hardware and software
configurations. Sending me a full description of the
circumstances in which the bug occurs, possibly with the data it
happened on, will help me tracking down a bug. If you have any
suggestions, you can also make them to me.
