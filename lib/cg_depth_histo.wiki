= Depth_histo =

== Format ==
cg depth_histo ?options? bamfile ?regionfile?

== Summary ==
makes a histogram of the depth in the given bamfile, subdivided in on- and oftarget regions

== Description ==
depth_histo outputs a [[tsv]] formatted histogram of the depth: For
each depth (column depth) the number of bases with this depth are given
in the target region (column ontarget) and outside the target region
(column offtarget). The target region is given in the regionfile in
[[tsv]] format. The histogram is by default limited to a maximum depth of
1000 (Positions with a depth >= 1000 are counted as depth 1000). This
can be changed with the -max option. Depths not presents in are skipped in the output

== Options ==
; -max maxnum: The maximum depth in the histogram (default = 1000). Positions with a depth >= maxnum are counted as depth maxnum
; -q num: Only count reads with base quality greater than num
; -Q num: Only count reads with mapping quality greater than num

== Arguments ==
; **bamfile**: bamfile
; **regionfile**: target regions. If no target regionfile is given, all bases will be counted in offtarget

== Example ==
{{{
cg depth_histo test.bam regfile.tsv > histo.tsv
}}}
