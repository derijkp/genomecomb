== Format ==
cg tsvdiff ?options? file1 file2

== Summary ==
compare tsv files

== Description ==
tsvdiff compares tsv files, taking into account that they are tsv files
(if they have an extension indicating they are tsv files):
* order of fields is ignored: If the same fields are present but in a 
different order, this is not shown as a difference
* Extra fields are only indicated in the beginning (header difference), 
not in all the data lines. If file1 and file2 are directories, they are 
recursively traversed and the diff made between all files in them.
* Files are compared decompressed: files can be equal even if one 
file is compressed and the other not.

== Arguments ==
; file1: file to compared to file2
; file2: file to be compared to file1

== Options ==
; -q 0/1 (-brief): only show files which differ (not the differences of each file)
; -c 0/1: ignore differences in comments
; -f fields: only compare the given fields
; -x excludepattern (-exclude): exclude files that match **excludepattern**. This option can be given multiple times
; -i ignorefields (-ignorefields): ignore differences in the given fields. This option  can only be given once. For more fields, give a (space spearated) list.
; -t l/xl/sd/diff (-type): type of diff: 
l first converts files to a long format where each line is split so that for each field you get a line of the form "fieldname fieldvalue"
xl is similar to l, but adds extra data describing the variant or region before each line (-> variant fieldname fieldvalue)
; -y 0/1 (-side-by-side): compare side by side
; -sc 0/1 (-suppress-common-lines): do not show common lines (in side by side comparison
; -split 0/1 (-splitlines): add an extra empty line between each line before comparison (this will split up multiline diffs)
; -s 0/1/list (-sort): sort tsv files before comparing (sort order is ignored)
; -d progname (-diffprog): show diff using **progname** (conversion from e.g. xl type is done first)
; -w number (-width): number of characters the display is wide (for side by side)
; -lines number: only compare the first **number** of lines
