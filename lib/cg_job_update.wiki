== Format ==
cg job_update ?options? logfile ..

== Summary ==
updates the logfile of a command using [[joboptions]]

== Description ==
If the logfile of a command using [[joboptions]] has the extension
.running, the command (or its jobs on a cluster) is either still running
or it crashed without being able to update the log. 
cg job_update can be used to update the log to current status. The status
(and times, ...) for each job will be updated.
If the command is no longer running, the logfile will get the extension .finished
if all jobs were successfully run, and .error if any of them had errors.

== Options ==
; -c success/never/allways (-dcleanup): by default (**success**) the log_jobs directories containing
run, log, error, wtc. files are removed after a successful run, but not after one with errors.
**never** will always keep the job_log dirs, and **allways** will always remove them.
after a succesfull run
; -f 0/1 (-force): use 1 to force aquiring job metadata from log_jobs dirs, 
even if it already in the logfile
; -r 0/1 (-dremoveold): remove older logfiles, keeping only the last one
