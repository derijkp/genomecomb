== Format ==
cg sc_pseudobulk scgenefile scisoformfile groupfile

== Summary ==
make pseudobulk files of sc_gene and sc_transcript files based on an sc_group file

== Description ==
cg sc_pseudobulk creates pseudobulk files at the gene and transcript
level starting from the single cell gene and transcript files,
and a grouping file that assigns each cell/barcode to a group (e.g. celltype)
The resulting pseudobulk files will be named pb_gene_counts-rootname.tsv.zst
pb_isoform_counts-rootname.tsv.zst where rootname is based on the filename
of the given groupfile

== Arguments ==
; scgenefile: tab separated file with gene information (output of e.g. scywalker) and UMI counts per gene/per cell
; scisoformfile: tab separated file with transcript information (in the [[transcript]] tsv format, output of e.g. scywalker) and UMI counts per gene/per cell
; groupfile: tsv file containing assignement of cells/barcodes to cell-types (or any other grouping)

== Category ==
RNA
