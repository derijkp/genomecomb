== Format ==
cg fastq_split file ...

== Summary ==
split a (large) fastq file in multiple smaller ones

== Description ==
cg fastq_split will split a (large) fastq file in several smaller fastq files.
You can either specify the target number of sequences per output file (-numseq option),
or the target number of files you want to generate (-parts option).

The command supports parrallel processing using the [[joboptions]]. The
first part (splitting up the file) cannot be parralelized, and can only be
run as a separated job on a cluster using the -parts option. (Using
-numseq, the first part is always run directly, because the command cannot
know up front how many parts will be generated, and thus not submit the
follow up compression jobs

== Arguments ==
; **infile** ...: fastq file to split
; **outtemplate** ...: template for filenames that will be generated

== Options ==
; **-numseq number**: number of sequences to store per output file
; **-parts number**: number of output files to generate (this option has preference)
; **-maxparts number**: maximum number of parts that will be generated (if numseq is small, last part will contain all remaining sequenced)
; **-threads number**: number of threads to use to compress the output files (bgzip -@)
