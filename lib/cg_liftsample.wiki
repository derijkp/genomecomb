= liftsample =

== Format ==
cg liftsample sampledir resultdir liftoverfile

== Summary ==
Use liftover to convert the files from a sample (variant, region, ...) from one build to another

== Description ==
Converts a sample from one build to another (using liftover from ucsc).
A liftover conversion is likely to cause loss of information: not all variants/regions
can be properly converted. Variants that were dropped in the conversion, will be
available in resultfile.unmapped.


== Arguments ==
; **sampledir**: file in tsv format (with variant data)
; **resultdir**: resulting converted file
; **liftoverfile**: liftover file guiding the conversion,
e.g. hg18ToHg19.over.tsv to convert from hg18 to hg19, and hg19ToHg18.over.tsv to convert from hg19 to hg18
