== Format ==
cg graph ?tsvfile? ...

== Summary ==
Visualization of large tsv files as a scatter plot

== Description ==
cg graph was made to visualize the large tsv files made by the structural variant caller
as a scatter plot. It allows interactive scrolling through regions of the genome, without
loading the entire file(s) into memory.
You can also add/display other types of data (coverage plot, rough gene
locations). The graph can only display one chromosome at the time, which
you will have to select when loading the data (If you select different chromosomes
for two files in the same display, they will be simply overlayed.)

== Arguments ==
; **tsvfile**: tsvfile to display

== Category ==
tsv
