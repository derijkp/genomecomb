== Summary ==
submit a command to the cluster (grid engine).

== Description ==
Convenience function to esily run a command as a job on a (grid engine) cluster

== Arguments ==
; **cmd** ...: command (and parameters) to be executed

== Options ==
; -o outputfile (-outputfile): Output of the command will be written to the given outputfile. By default,
the filename job_$name.out will be used
; -e errorfile (-errorfile): stderr output of the command will be written
to the given errorfile. By default, the filename job_$name.err will be
used
; -name name: specify name to job (default generated based on the command)
; -run run: specify the run name for the job (default generated based on the command)
; -lang interpreter: use **cmd** as a piece of code to be run with the given interpreter, e.g. '''-lang python''' or '''-lang R''' (further arguments after cmd are ignored in this case)
; -mem memorysize: indication of (maximum) memory needed by the job (on sge: -l mem_free=$value,virtual_free=$value, where value is corrected by the system based on -cores)
; -memlimit memorysize: limit memory use of the job to the given amount (on sge: -l h_vmem=$value where value is corrected by the system based on -cores)
; -cores numcores: give value > 1 if job uses more than 1 core (on sge hard option: "-pe local $value" if local pe is defined)
If using multiple cores, other requirements on sge are per core!
For memory (-mem) this conversion will be done by the system, and you must give the total required memory (for the job)
; -time timelimit: indication of (maximum) time needed by the job (on sge: -l s_rt=$time)
; -dqueue value: (only for sge) Use this option if you want to run on another queue than the default all.q
; -deps ids: job will only run when the jobs in ids (a comma separated list of job ids)
; -hard hardlimits: on sge: extra options passed on as hard limits
; -soft softlimits: on sge: extra options passed on as soft limits
