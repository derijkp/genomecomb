== Format ==
cg shadow_mkdir ?options? dir ?shadowdir?

== Summary ==
create a shadowed dir 

== Description ==
cg shadow_mkdir creates a directory **dir** that is
actually a softlink pointing to a (generated) storage directory (shadow) in
another location, typically on another (file)system.

The shadow is made as a subdirectory of the directory **shadowdir**: This can be given using the option -shadowdir
or else the environment variable SHADOWDIR is used.
If -shadowdir is not specified, nor the environment variable SHADOWDIR defined, a normal directory will be made instead
(i.e. like a simple "mkdir $dir")

== Arguments ==
; dir: "directory" to be made

== Options ==
; -shadowdir shadowdir: The actual storage directory (shadow) wil be generated in **shadowdir**

== Use ==
Shadow dirs are esp. usefull to provide a faster and/or untracked (by e.g.
zfs snapshots or backups) storage location for making temporary/intermediate files
that should still be accessible from different jobs and nodes in the
original data structure. 

genomecomb e.g. uses workdirs to temporarily store the the temporary results from
separate jobs aligning fastqs, variant calling of separate regions, etc. 
and combines the results (in yet another job).
If SHADOWDIR is defined, shadows are used for these workdirs; these
can be located on a fast ssd server separate from the experiment directory, 
while not filling up space (and potentially being snapshot or synced to
backup) on the experiment storage.

== Deletion ==
To delete a shadow, use
{{{
cg shadow_delete dir
}}}
shadow_delete will delete both the link and the shadow storage, after
checking it is actually a shadow dir (It will give an error if the shadow
dir contains a softlink named shadow_source, which shadow_mkdir makes to
point to dir). If dir is not a link, the directory will be deleted.

== Clean ==
If you would use e.g. ```rm dir``` only  the link would be deleted; the
actual (orphaned now) storage dir would remain. You can clean out orphaned
storage dirs from shadowdir using
{{{
cg shadow_clean ?shadowdir?
}}}
To see if a shadow is orphaned, shadow_clean checks the link named
shadow_source in the shadow dir. If shadow_source no longer exists, the
shadow is deleted; Beware that if you moved shadow_source (by e.g.
moving the directory in which it is located), it will not be found, and
the shadow dir deleted on shadow_clean.
