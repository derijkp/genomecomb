== Format ==
cg long ?infile? ?outfile?

== Summary ==
Converts data in tsv format from wide format (data for each sample in separate columns) 
to long format (data for each sample in separate lines)


== Description ==
Genomecomb usually expects data in tsv files in wide format, where some fields are common/general
for all samples (e.g. chromosome, begin, end, .. for variants) and some fields have specific
values for each sample (e.g. quality, coverage, ...). In wide format these columns are named by
adding "-samplename" to the fieldname. In the long format, sample specific data is on separate
lines (the common fields are repeated in each line). 
"cg long" converts from wide to long format.
"[[cg_wide]]" can be used for the reverse.

== Arguments ==
; **infile**: file to be converted, if not given, uses stdin. File may be compressed.
; **outfile**: write results to outfile, if not given, uses stdout

== Category ==
