== Format ==

== Summary ==
Complete or correct ref and alt fields in variation file

== Description ==
This command adds ref and alt fields to a variation file that misses them, and fills them.
If a ref fields is already present, its contents will be checked, and an error given if there
is a difference with the genome sequence in dbdir. Use -f (force) to correct the ref column.
alt wil be updated if alleleSeq* fields are present in the variant file.

== Arguments ==
; **srcfile**: variations file
; **dstfile**: resulting variations file
; **dbdir**: database directory with reference sequence, etc.

== Options ==
; **-f**: force overwrite of ref if different from genome sequence in **dbdir**, instead of giving error
; **-c**: overwrite ref if different from genome only when it is complement of ref, 
  alt and alleleSeq* are also changed to complement if ref is complement.
