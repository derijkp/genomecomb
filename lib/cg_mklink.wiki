== Format ==
cg mklink ?options? source ... dest

== Summary ==
Create softlinks (improved)

== Description ==
cg mklink creates softlinks using a syntax similar to "ln -s": **dest** will be a softlink pointing 
to **src**. If **dest** is a directory, more than one src can be linked/copied.

cg mklink "improves" on using ln -s in following ways:
* You do not have to be in the dest directory to get the correct relative link.
The correct relative link will be calculated based on the full path of src and dest, 
no matter where your pwd is, no matter if src is given as an absolute path, or as an extended relative path.
* The link (dest) will get the same time as **src**
* Links can be created to files that do not exist (yet)
* If dest is a link, it will be overwritten, if it is a real file, an error is given

== Arguments ==
; src: file to be copied
; dest: destination

== Options ==
; -absolute 0/1 (-a): softlinks will use absolute paths if 1, relative paths if 0 (default)
