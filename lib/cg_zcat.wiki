= zcat =

== Format ==
cg zcat file ...

== Summary ==
pipe contents of one or more (potentially compressed) files to stdout.

== Description ==
This conveniance function works like zcat, taking a number of files and
outputting there contents (concatenated) to stdout. If the file has an
extension indicating it is compressed, it will be decompressed before
piping to stdout. In contrast to zcat, cg zcat supports more types of
compression (lz4, gz, bgz, rz, bz2), and files of different compression
may be mixed.

== Arguments ==
; **file** ...: file to be sent to stdout

== Options ==
; -p position (-pos): start output at the given position (byte). 
This will be fast for formats supporting random access (lz4, rz). 
For others the entire file will be decompressed and skipped up to the given position.
