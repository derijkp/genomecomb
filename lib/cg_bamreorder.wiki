== Format ==
cg bamreorder bamfile resultbamfile referencegenome

== Summary ==
Changes the order of the contigs/chromosomes in a bam file 

== Description ==
This command uses picard's ReorderSam to change the order of the
contigs/chromosomes in a bam file to that of the given genome reference.
It first checks the contigs in each, adapting the names (e.g. 1 to chr1)
where needed and checking if sizes match. Contigs with matching names, but
different size are dropped from the bam.

== Arguments ==
; **bamfile**: bamfile
; **resultbamfile**: name of resulting reordered bamfile
; **referencegenome**: a indexed fasta file of the genome. If the file is not indexed, the command will try to create the index (using samtools)
