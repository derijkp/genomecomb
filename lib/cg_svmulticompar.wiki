== Summary ==
Compare multiple structural variant files

== Description ==
This command is used to create multi sv compar_files.
These are tab separated files indicating structural variants present in one or more samples.
As structural variant (sv) calls are usually imprecise, the sv (of
different samples) are approximately matched: Begin, end or alt values do
not have to match exactly. The global variant features (chromosome, begin, end, type, ref, alt)
are taken from the first sample the variant is seen in. (so there can be
small differences due to order of samples given) The values for begin, end
and alt values of each sample are kept as lbegin-sample, lend-sample and
lalt-sample.

== Arguments ==
; **svmulticomparfile**: resultfile, will be created if it does not exist
; **svfile**: file containing structural variants of new sample to be added
More than one svfile can added in one command

== Options ==
; -margin number: Allow begin and end to deviate the number of bases given (default 30)
; -lmargin number: Allow begin and end to deviate the number of bases given for deletions, inversions, trans and bnd (default 300)
; -tmargin number: Allow begin and end to deviate the number of bases given for translocations (trans) and breakends (bnd) (default 300)
; -minoverlap number: minimum percent overlap needed to identify deletions or inversions as the same (default 75)
