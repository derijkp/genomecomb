== Format ==
cg sam2tsv ?options? ?infile? ?outfile?

== Summary ==
Converts data in sam format to [[tsv]] format. The original sam header is
included in the comments. Extra fields in the sam file are kept as
field:type:value, but put together as a list in a column named other.
Optionally the values for some extra fields can be split into different
columns using the -fields option.

== Arguments ==
; **infile**: file to be converted, if not given, uses stdin. File may be compressed.
; **outfile**: write results to outfile, if not given, uses stdout

== Options ==
; -f fields: list of fields to go in separate columns. The list can eiter
contain just the fieldname, in which case type and description are taken
from a number of known fields. If the field is unknown, type will be
String(Z) and desciption empty. You can also specify type and field in the
list as field:type:description where type is in the sam format (i,Z,..)
; -addfield field: add one field to fields; this option can be given multiple times.
