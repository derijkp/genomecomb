== Description ==
cg sh makes it possible to test out tcl code interactively, with all genomecomb commands/extensions available.

By default, the editline library is used (through eltclsh) to allow the use pf arrow keys to go back in history,
catch signals (Control-C) and complete commands/variables/files. Completion will not happen by using the
tab key (which will just enter a tab character) but by usin Control-o.

== Options ==

; **nox**: Do not use tclx (or editline) for the shell. You will not be able to use arrow keys, etc.
; **console**: Use tcl console for input (and output)
