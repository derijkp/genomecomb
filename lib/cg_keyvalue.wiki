== Summary ==
Converts data in tsv format from wide format (data for each sample in separate columns) 
to keyvalue format.

== Description ==
Converts a tsv file containing different values of an object in one row (different fields) into 
a key-value format: Each of the rows is split into multiple rows (one for each data column) 
containing fields identifying the object followed by the fields key (fieldname of data column in original) \
and value (value in the data column).

The fields identifying the object can be specified using the -idfields option, but defaults to sample or id.
sample as id field is treated special (unless an actual sample field is present in the file):
The actual sample value is extracted from the fieldname (field-sample).

== Arguments ==
; **infile**: file to be converted, if not given, uses stdin. File may be compressed.
; **outfile**: write results to outfile, if not given, uses stdout

== Options ==
; -idfields list: which fields identify the object (default sample or id)
; -samplefields samplefields: Using this option, sample names that consist of several parts separated by - (as typical in 
genomecomb output, e.g. -gatk-rdsbwa-sample1) are split up in separate fields with the field names given by **samplefields**
