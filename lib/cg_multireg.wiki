== Summary ==
Compare multiple regions files

== Description ==
This command is used to create multiregion compar_files.
These are tab separated files indicating which regions
are present in multiple samples. The first columns indicate the
position of the region using the chromosome,begin,end columns. These are
followed by columns containing 1 if the region
is present in samplename and 0 if not.

== Arguments ==
; **compar_file**: file containing regions, and columns indicating the presence of the region
; **file**: region files to be added the compar_file.
  The name of the column is name of the file added without extension

== Options ==
; **-m maxopenfiles** (--maxopenfiles): The number of files that a program
can keep open at the same time is limited. pmulticompar will distribute
the subtasks thus, that the number of files open at the same time stays
below this number. With this option, the maximum number of open files can
be set manually (if the program e.g. does not deduce the proper limit, or
you want to affect the distribution).
