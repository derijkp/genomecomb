== Format ==
cg tsvjoin ?options? file1 file2 ?outfile?

== Summary ==
join two tsv files based on common fields (must be sorted).

== Description ==
tsvjoin creates a new tsv file joining the two given input tsv files. The
new tsv adds extra fields from the second tsv to the first where the
idfields are the same between the two. Both files must be sorted on their
respective id fields.

== Arguments ==
; **file1**: input file 1
; **file2**: input file 2
; **outfile**: write results to outfile, if not given, uses stdout

== Options ==
; -idfields list: which fields identify the object in file1, and should be
match the id fields in file2 (default is all fields with the same name
between the 2 files)
; -idfields2 list: which fields identify the object in file2, and should be match the id fields in file1 (default is same fields as for file1)
; -pre1 string: prefix all fieldnames (except the idfields) coming from file1 with **string**
; -pre2 string: prefix all fieldnames (except the idfields) coming from file2 with **string**
; -type inner/full/left/right: determines the type of join:
In an **inner** join only lines are present where the id was found in both files. A **left**
join shows all lines of file1; if the id values where not found in file2, the file2 based fields
are empty. A **right** join contains all lines in file2 and a **full** join has data for all lines
in both files, putting empty values where needed.
