== Summary ==
Make input files for designing sequenom validation experiments

== Description ==
This command makes an input file that can be used for sequenom assay design for the variants
in targetsfile. Targetsfile is a tab delimited file with at least following columns:
chromosome begin end ref alt

== Arguments ==
; **targetsfile**: tab delimited file containing targets with at least following columns: chromosome begin end ref alt
; **resultfile**: sequenom assay setup results
; **dbdir**: directory containing reference genomes and variation data

== Options ==
; **-f freq**: only softmask (lowercase) dbsnp variants if they have a frequency > freq (default is 0, use -1 to include all)
; **-n freq**: only mask (using N) dbsnp variants if they have a frequency > freq (default is 0.2, use -1 to include all)
