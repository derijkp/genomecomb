cg bam2fastq ?options? bamfile fastqfile1 ?fastqfile2?

== Summary ==
Extracts reads from a bamfile into fastq. 
The actual extraction is based on picard's SamToFastq or samtools bam2fq, but the data is 
prepared first (ao. sorted by name to avoid the problems caused by position sorted fq files)

== Arguments ==
; **bamfile**: bamfile
; **fastqfile1**: name of the fastq file that will contain the first read of each pair. If it has an extension .gz, the fastqs will be compressed
; **fastqfile2**: name of the fastq file that will contain the matching second read of each pair

== Options ==
; -m biobambam/picard/sam (--method): which method is used underneath (default = biobambam)
; -namesort 0/1: sort (based on name) before converting; this may avoid biases during (re)alignment because of position based sort (default = 1)
; -single file (-s): file to write single reads
; -unmatched file (-u): file to write unmatched first reads from pair
; -unmatched2 file (-u2): file to write unmatched second reads from pair
