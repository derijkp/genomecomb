== Summary ==
finds regions of homozygosity based on a variant file

== Description ==
This command searches for regions of homozygosity for the samples given
based on the variant file variantfile. 
variantfile should preferably be a tab separated (Genomecomb) file with
annotations. A vcf file will also be accepted, but dbdir should be given to
annotate it.
The homozygous regions are stored in resultfile (if resultfile is not
given, the name of the resultfile will be based on the variantfile.
A directory with the base name of resultfile and extension work will be
created that contains all intermidiate data.

== Arguments ==
; **variantfile**: tab separated or vcf file containing variants from exome sequencing
; **samples**: samples to be analysed. If it is the empty, all samples in the file be used
; **resultfile**: file to which the resulting regions of homozygosity will be written.
If more than one sample is analysed, it will be a multiregion file
containing the comparison of all samples, with the individual results available in fales named
resultfileroot-sample.tsv

== Options ==
: **-dbdir**: directory with reference databases;
        this is needed if the annotcomparfile is not annotated (e.g. a vcf file)
; **-callers**: default is 'gatk-rdsbwa- sam-rdsbwa-'
; **-variantsonly**: only include positions wich are variant in the sample 
               (so reference positions are discarded)
; **-snpsonly**: only use variants of type snp
; **-htz**: numner of heterozygous snps allowed per window
; **-density**: plink --homozyg-density option
; **-gap**: plink --homozyg-gap option
; **-window**: plink --homozyg-window-snp option
