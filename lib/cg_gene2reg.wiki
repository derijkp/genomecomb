= gene2reg =

== Format ==
cg gene2reg ?infile? ?outfile?

== Summary ==
Extract gene elements from data in genepred-like format to a (tab separated) region file.

== Description ==
cg gene2reg outputs a [[tsv]] file with the location  and meta info about each element of a gene 
on a separate line. The output is a region file (fields chromosome, begin, end) that typically 
includes the following extra fields:
; type: UTR, CDS, intron, RNA
; element: exon1, intron1, exon2, intron1, ...
; rna_start: start of the element on the RNA sequence
; rna_end: end of the element on the RNA sequence
; protein_start: start of the element on the RNA sequence relative to the protein start
; protein_end: start of the element on the RNA sequence relative to the protein start
; gene: gene name
; transcript: transcript id

== Arguments ==
; **infile**: file to be converted, if not given, uses stdin. File may be compressed.
; **outfile**: write results to outfile, if not given, uses stdout

== Category ==
