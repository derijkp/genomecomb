= viz =

== Format ==
cg viz tsvfile

== Summary ==
grahical vizualization of tsv files (even very large ones) as table without loading everything into memory

== Description ==
This command starts a GUI for browsing (large) [[tsv]] files. 
cg viz never loads the entire table into memory, allowing for browsing huge files
with millions of lines. 
The file is indexed to provide fast random access. First access to a file
is slow because the index has to made.
Alternatively, the [[cg_index]] command can be used to create the index beforehand

The table can be viewed and queried in various ways. Look in [[howto_view]] for some
examples of what you can do in cg_viz (and how).

== Arguments ==
; **tsvfile** ...: tsvfile to display

== Category ==
Query
