= liftregion =

== Format ==
cg liftregion regionfile liftoverfile resultfile

== Summary ==
Use liftover to convert a region file from one build to another

== Description ==
Converts a regionfile from one build to another (using liftover from ucsc).
The region are lifted as separate 1 base long parts, meaning that a region can be split or miss parts.
A liftover conversion is likely to cause loss of information: not all variants/regions
can be properly converted. Variants that were dropped in the conversion, will be
available in resultfile.unmapped.


== Arguments ==
; **regionfile**: file in tsv format (with region data)
; **liftoverfile**: liftover file guiding the conversion,
e.g. hg18/hg18ToHg19.over.chain to convert from hg18 to hg19, and hg19/hg19ToHg18.over.chain to convert from hg19 to hg18
; **resultfile**: resulting converted file
