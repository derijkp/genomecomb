== Summary ==
Extracts transcript sequences based on a transcript tsv file ([[format_transcript]]) and stores them in a fasta file.

== Description ==
genepredtsv2fasta takes a tsv file (with fields as described in [[format_transcript]])
and extracts the sequences of the transcripts in the file from the reference sequence (which
must be given using -refseq path) and stores them in fasta format in the result file.

== Arguments ==
; gene_tsv: tsv file with the [[format_transcript]] fields
; fastafile: output file in fasta format

== Options ==
; -refseq path: path to the reference sequence (or refdir). This must be given
