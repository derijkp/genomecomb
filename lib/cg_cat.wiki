cg cat ?options? file ?file? ...

== Summary ==
Concatenate tab separated files and print on the standard output (stripping headers of files 
other than the first).

== Description ==
Concatenate tab separated files and print on the standard output.
Headers of tab files others than the first one will be stripped. If one of the tab file does not have 
the same fields as the first, an error is given, unless the merge or force options are used.

== Arguments ==
; **file** ...: files to be concatenated

== Options ==
; **-m**: if the merge option is given, tab files with different fields will be merged: The resulting tab file has
each field that occurs in at least one of the source files. If a given field is not present in one of the source files,
it will be empty for each line coming from this file.
; **-f**: if the force option is given, tab files with different fields will still be concatenated without error.
; **-s**: if the sort option is given, the files will be sorted (natural sort order) before being concatenated.
This is usefull for e.g. concatenating files split over chromosomes in the correct order.
; **-c 0/1**: if -c is 1 (default), the names of the files that are concatenated are added in the comment, 
if 0 no extra comments are added. You can use the value f to only display the comment of the first file, 
or n to leave out comments completely.

By default (3), the comments of all files are added, with an extra comments showing the source file.
Use 0 to remove all comments, 1 to add the comments of the first file only, 2 to add comments of all files
