== Summary ==
Compresses files using zstd

== Description ==
The given files are compressed using zstd, and the original uncompressed
files are removed (by default). Files already compressed using another
method, are recompressed using zstd. zstd is a fast compression method, at
the default compression level (8), it compresses and decompresses an order
of magnitude faster than gzip, while also providing substantially better
compression. At the highest compression levels, zstd can rival bzip2/xz
for compression, though it will then be substantially slower at
compression (than gzip). Decompression is allways fast.

== Options ==
supports options:
; -k 0/1 (--keep): keep the original uncompressed file if 1 (default 0)
; -c number (--compressionlevel): number between 1 and 22 indicating compression level, where 1 = fast compression, 22 = high compression (default 8)
; -b number (--blocksize): number indicating the blocksize in Kb (default 512)
; -i 0/1 (--index): also create an zst index file
; -t number (--threads); number of threads used to compress
; -o filename (--outputfile): The compressed file will be written to **filename**. 
If the --keep option is not explicitely given, using -o will change the "default" for -k to 1.
