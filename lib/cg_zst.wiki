== Summary ==
Compresses files using zstd

== Description ==
The given files are compressed using zstd, and the original uncompressed files
are removed (by default). Files already compressed using another method,
are recompressed using zstd. zstd is a fast compression method, it compresses
and decompresses an order of magnitude faster than gzip, while also
providing better compression.

== Options ==
supports options:
; -k 0/1 (--keep): keep the original uncompressed file if 1 (default 0)
; -c number (--compressionlevel): number between 1 and 12 indicating compression level, where 1 = fast compression, 9 = high compression (default 9)
At high compression (9), compression level and speed is similar to gzip, but decompression is still an 
order of magnitude faster
; -b number (--blocksize): number indicating the blocksize where: 4 = 64KB, 5 = 256KB, 6 = 1MB, 7 = 4MB (default 5)
; -i 0/1 (--index): also create an zst index file
; -o filename (--outputfile): The compressed file will be written to **filename**. 
If the --keep option is not explicitely given, using -o will change the "default" for -k to 1.
