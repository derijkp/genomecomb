== Summary ==
Compresses files using lz4

== Description ==
The given files are compressed using lz4, and the original uncompressed files
are removed (by default). Files already compressed using another method,
are recompressed using lz4. lz4 is a fast compression method, it compresses
and decompresses an order of magnitude faster than gzip, at the cost of
some compression.

== Options ==
supports options:
; **-k**: keep the original uncompressed file if 1 (default 0)
; **-c**: compression level, where 1 = fast compression and 9 = high compression (default 1)
At high compression (9), compression is slower than gzip, but decompression is still much faster
