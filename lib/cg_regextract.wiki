== Summary ==
Find regions above or below a given cutoff in a bam, bcol or tsv file.

== Description ==
Write a regionsfile to stdout that contains all regions in the given file(s) that
are above or below a given cutoff. 

If there is no chromosome data in the input files (tsv without chromosome), the chromosome name is
taken from the filename by splitting on "-", and taking the second
element.

== Arguments ==
; **cutoff**: cutoff
; **file1**: file containing (chromosome,) position and value columns, or bcol file.
; **...**: other files
 
== Options ==
; **-qfields**: list (separated by spaces) of possible fieldnames to use as values
            for the cutoff; The first in the list that is in the header will be used
            (default = "coverage uniqueSequenceCoverage").
            This option is not used for bcol files, as they contain data for only one "column".
; **-posfields**: list (separated by spaces) of possible fieldnames to use as position;
            The first in the list that is in the header will be used
            (default = "offset pos position begin start").
            This option is not used for bcol files.
; **-above**: 1 if regions should contain values > given cutoff.
          defaults to 0, meaning values should be < the cutoff.
; **-shift**: change the position by the given amount, e.g. -1 to change from
          1-based to 0-based coordinates
