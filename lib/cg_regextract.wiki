== Summary ==
Find regions above or below a given cutoff.

== Description ==
Write a regionsfile to stdout that contains all regions in the given files that
are above or below a given cutoff. Each file contains data for one chromosome.
Chromosome name is taken from the filename by splitting on "-", and taking 
the second element.

== Arguments ==
; **cutoff**: regions file
; **file1**: file containing position and value columns.
; **...**: other files
 
== Options ==
; **-qfields**: list (separated by spaces) of possible fieldnames to use as values
            for the cutoff; The first in the list that is in the header will be used
            (default = "coverage uniqueSequenceCoverage")
; **-posfields**: list (separated by spaces) of possible fieldnames to use as position;
              The first in the list that is in the header will be used
              (default = "offset pos position begin start")
; **-above**: 1 if regions should contain values > given cutoff.
          defaults to 0, meaning values should be < the cutoff.
; **-shift**: change the position by the given amount, e.g. -1 to change from
          1-based to 0-based coordinates
