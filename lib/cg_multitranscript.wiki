== Summary ==
Compare multiple transcript files

== Description ==
This command combines multiple transcript files into one multitranscript file; a
tab separated file containing a wide table used to compare transcript (counts)
between different samples. Each line in the table contains general transcript
info (chromosome, begin, end, strand, exonStarts, exonEnds, ?cdsStart?,
?cdsEnd?, ?transcript?, ?gene?, ?geneid?) and columns with transcript info
specific to each sample (count, etc.). The latter have a
column heading of the form field-<sample>.

<sample> can be simply the samplename, but may also include information
about e.g. the sequencing or analysis method in the form method-samplename, e.g.
count_weighed-isoquant-sample1.tsv.

When a transcript was not detected in a sample, the value in the table is set to 0.0.

By default multitranscript will use approximate matching for novel
transcripts (based on the content of the field "category"): Novel
transcripts will be matched if they have identical junction chains, even
if the (predicted) ends differ.  The resulting transcript will have the
lowest start and highest end position of these matches. The id of these
result transcripts will be changed to one unique for that transcript and
consistent over different experiments (based on location and intron/exon
sizes)


== Arguments ==
; multitranscriptfile: resultfile, will be created if it does not exist
; transcriptfile: file containing transcript of a new sample to be added
  More than one can added in one command

== Options ==
; -exact 0/1: use exact matching
; -match pattern: For all transcripts whose id/name matches
**pattern** (using regexp) approximate matching will be used. (overruling the value in
category, though this will still be used to see which name will be given
to the result; known preferred)
; -skipempty 0/1: skip isoform files which are empty (size = 0) (default 1)
