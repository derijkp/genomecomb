= renamesamples =

== Format ==
cg renamesamples dir/file samplename newsamplename ...

== Summary ==
Converts the sample names in a file or entire directory to other names.

== Description ==
The command converts the sample names in a file or entire directory to
other names. This includes changing the header in multicompar files (tsv
or sft extension), or renaming the files or directories that contain the
sample name in the file name.

As a backup, the process will create a subdirectory rename.old with the
original (named) data in it. The files in rename.old are hardlinks to the
renamed files, so this backup does not take a lot of storage space. You
might still want to remove it when you are sure the rename went ok: It
does cause double the number of files, and when moving or backing up the
experiment directory the hardlinks may be broken (failing to take into
account hardlinks), causing duplication of storage.

== Arguments ==
; **dir/file**: file or directory to be converted.
; **samplename**: current name of sample
; **newsamplename**: new name of sample

== Category ==
